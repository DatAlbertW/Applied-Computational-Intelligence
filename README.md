## Optimization Approach: Classification of Brain Tumor Images Using Convolutional Neural Network (EfficientNet)

This project investigates the classification of brain tumor images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). The primary objective is to optimize hyperparameters for the diagnosis of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans.
